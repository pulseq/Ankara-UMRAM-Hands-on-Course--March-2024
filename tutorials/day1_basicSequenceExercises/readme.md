# Basic Pulseq Tutorial
## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 Programming Tools
Matlab software (https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) needs to be installed in your computer.   
Basic familiarity with Matlab programming is required.   
### 1.2 Pulseq Software
Please download the Pulseq software from https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq. Install Pulseq software in Matlab by adding its directory and subdirectories to Matlab's path.   
### 1.3 mapVBVD Software
The mapVBVD software is required to read raw data in Siemens TWIX format. The software can be downloaded from https://github.com/pehses/mapVBVD and installed by adding its directory to Matlab's path.
### 1.4 Text Compare Tool
We recommend using a text comparison tool to compare the sequences within the subsequent steps to visualize the changes that occur at each
step. *Meld* software can be used for text comparison and can be downloaded from <https://meldmerge.org/>. By using Meld or other comparable software packages, it is possible to very quickly make the relevant changes easily visible, as in the example below.

## 2. Sequence Folder
### 2.1 Basic MR Spectroscopy
* *s01_FID*: the simplest free induction decay (FID) sequence;   
* *s02_SE*: spin-echo (SE) sequence without gradients;   
* *s03_SE_crushers*: SE sequence with a pair of crushers to eliminate spurious signals arising from the imperfect 180 deg RF pulse.   
### 2.2 Basic MR Imaging
* *s11_GRE2D*: basic 2D gradient echo (GRE) sequence;   
* *s12_GRE2D_optimizedSpoiler*: 2D GRE with optimized spoiler timing;   
* *s13_GRE2D_acceleratedComputation*: 2D GRE with optimized spoiler timing and accelerated computation.   

## 3. Data Folder
It contains the link to six k-space raw data acquired from the above sequences.      

## 4. Recon Folder
It contains six *.seq* files produced by the above sequences and the corresponding reconstruction scripts.  

## 5. Results Folder
It contains k-space raw data and reconstructed spectra/images from the six sequences.
